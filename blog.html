            On November 7, 2021, Natus Vincere beat G2 in the grand final of the PGL Major Stockholm 2021. This was one of the most exciting majors that I have been able to tune into, and I have been playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive since 2014. The player known as “s1mple” on Na’Vi’s roster is widely known as the best CS:GO player in history. Now having a major win, this has cemented the title for him even more. Na’Vi won the series 2-0 over G2. In the second game G2 was winning over Na’Vi 15-12, but they choked match point. This lead into overtime and eventually a win for Na’Vi. This major has been even more special for a multitude of reasons. For one, this was the most watched major in Counter-Strike’s history. It pulled in a massive 2.7 million viewers at its peak. While we are not fully out of the woods with Covid-19 yet, this was the first in-person major since it began. It was wonderful seeing a packed stadium to watch the best e-sport out there.
